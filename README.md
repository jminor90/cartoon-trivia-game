# cartoon-trivia-game 
A timed trivia game based on some of my favorite cartoons
Made in Javascript by jminor90

## Description

A short trivia application with a timer and a high scores feature, that I made to practice what I've learned in Javascript. Such as being able to manipulate local storage, and adding user interactivty with the website itself.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
