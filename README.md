# timed-trivia-game
A timed trivia game made in Javascript by jminor90

## Description

A short trivia application with a timer and a high scores feature, that I made to practice what I've learned in Javascript. Such as being able to manipulate local storage, and adding user interactivty with the website itself.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
